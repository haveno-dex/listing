# Listing

On this repository we'll coordinate the listing of new assets on Haveno. The community can open issues with the details of the proposed asset. Issue templates are provided to make applying consistent and organized. A [GitHub project is available](https://github.com/orgs/haveno-dex/projects/6) for a visual representation of the status of each request.

## Terms for listing

The Haveno Core Team lists asset based on their perception of the project proposed. Input from the community is welcome and highly kept in considered during the decision process. We invite to maintain high quality conversation and refrain from shilling/trolling. The latter would seriously impact the chances of listing the project proposed.

These terms are to be kept in consideration:

- In case the assets is approved for listing, we expect somebody from the project or the related community to take care of the PR for implementing it on Haveno
- At any time we might delist an asset if we feel there are reasons to do so
- All of the above is at discretion of the Haveno Core Team
